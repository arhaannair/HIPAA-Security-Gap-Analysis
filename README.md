# HIPAA Security Gap Analysis â€“ Clinic IT Infrastructure

## Project Overview

This project simulates a HIPAA Security Rule gap analysis for a sample healthcare clinic's IT infrastructure. The goal is to evaluate how well the current system design aligns with HIPAA safeguards for protecting electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), identify potential gaps, and recommend actions to improve compliance and security posture.

The analysis focuses on technical safeguards, with attention to administrative and physical controls where applicable. This project builds on the infrastructure design documented in Part 1.
